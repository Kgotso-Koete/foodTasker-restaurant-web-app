# About the project

Foodtasker is an UberEats clone in which customers can order takeaway food on through the customer mobile app, restaurants can accept and track orders

This is the code I wrote following the [Code4Startup](https://code4startup.com/) tutorial on building an UberEats clone (food ordering/delivery app) using the Python & Django stack and is based on the [foodTasker app tutorial](https://code4startup.com/).

This code is for the back end. [here is the tutorial](https://coderealprojects.com/projects/create-ubereats-api-server-side-with-python). The front end code I wrote can be found [here]().

Special thanks to Leo Trieu's [Code4Startup](https://code4startup.com/) for a great tutorial. I had been looking for a tutorial for a real world 2 sided market application with geo-location features and I found one with thanks to Code4Startup. We need more of this kind of tutorial and less of 'Foo Bar'.
